  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in
# parallel.  Here is where we do the work:
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build_and_test"
  build_and_test:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the
    # job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can
      # access it
